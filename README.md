# Sales Forecasting Platform on Azure Databricks

An end-to-end **Lakehouse + Machine Learning project** built on **Azure Databricks**, implementing **Unity Catalog governance**, **Medallion Architecture**, **Delta Lake**, **BI Dashboards**, and **MLflow-based demand forecasting**.

This project demonstrates how raw retail data can be securely ingested, cleaned, modeled, analyzed, and finally used to train and evaluate a machine learning model for **daily sales forecasting**.
